# Windows-Sysmon-Endpoint-Monitoring-with-Splunk-SIEM-and-Simulated-Attacker
## Objective

### To simulate a real-world security monitoring and threat detection environment using a Windows machine with Sysmon as the endpoint telemetry collector, Splunk as the centralized SIEM solution, and a Linux system as the attacking machine. The goal is to understand how endpoint events can be collected, analyzed, and used to detect malicious activity in a controlled lab setup.

## Points learned

### Endpoint Telemetry Collection (Sysmon)
- Installed and configured Sysmon on a Windows machine to capture detailed system activity logs.

- Customized the Sysmon configuration to reduce noise and focus on high-fidelity security events.

### SIEM Integration with Splunk:
- Deployed and configured Splunk to receive and index Sysmon logs.

- Created dashboards and alerts in Splunk to visualize suspicious behaviors

### Simulated Attack Scenarios (Linux Attacker)
- Used a Kali Linux machine to perform reverse shell attack to simulate real-world attack patterns.

- Observed how these attacks are logged by Sysmon and how they appear in Splunk.

##  Detecting suspicious alert
= Developed basic detection rules using Splunk to trigger alerts on suspicious events.

- Practiced threat hunting by tracing attacker actions through Sysmon logs.

## Conclusion


### This homelab provided practical, hands-on experience with endpoint monitoring, log collection, and SIEM-based threat detection.

- The value of endpoint visibility in early threat detection.

- Using Splunk to build detections and gain situational awareness.

- How attacker activities manifest in logs and how to trace them.

### Overall, this project strengthened my foundational knowledge in SOC operations, endpoint security, and adversary detectionâ€”critical skills for any role in cybersecurity, especially in threat detection and response.
